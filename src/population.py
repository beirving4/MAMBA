# put cosmic SFR here too?

# Put time/redshift conversions for cosmology in here then only pass VirialProperties object to halo

# May need to set virial parameters here to deal with change cosmology parameters

# Ratio of Centrals to Satellites (Actually put this in poplation!)
    # ratio : float = field(default=1.0)  
# Be able to split due to centrals to satellites  

# Parameters for UniverseMachine & Trinity Fits with proper central and satellite splits 
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
